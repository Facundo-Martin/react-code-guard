ESLint Configuration for a Next.js Project
------------------------------------------

This configuration file is designed to lint a Next.js project using TypeScript. It includes a number of best practices and some additional suggestions.

### Environment

- "root": true: This tells ESLint to stop looking for configurations in parent folders.
- "browser": true, "es6": true, "node": true: These options configure the environment in which the code is running, in this case, we are indicating that the code will run in a browser and Node.js environment, and it conforms to the ECMAScript 6 specification.

### Settings

- "react": {"version": "detect"}: This setting ensures that the correct version of React is being used in the project by automatically detecting it.

### Parser and Parser Options

- "parser": "@typescript-eslint/parser": This tells ESLint to use the @typescript-eslint/parser to parse the TypeScript code.
- "project": "./tsconfig.json": This tells the parser the relative path of the tsconfig.json file so that it can use the same settings.
- "ecmaFeatures": {"jsx": true}: This option enables JSX syntax in the codebase
- "ecmaVersion": 12: This option sets the version of ECMAScript syntax used in the project to version 12.
- "sourceType": "module": Indicates that the codebase is using ECMAScript modules.

### Plugins

- "@typescript-eslint": Provides TypeScript-specific linting rules.
- "@next/eslint-plugin-next": Provides Next.js-specific linting rules.
- "prettier": Linting rules that integrate with the Prettier code formatter.
- "@typescript-eslint/recommended": Provides a set of recommended TypeScript linting rules.
- "@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin": TypeScript-specific rules that are defined in the ESLint rules format.

### Extends

- "eslint:recommended": Provides a set of recommended linting rules for JavaScript.
- "plugin:react/recommended": Provides recommended linting rules for React.
- "@typescript-eslint/recommended": Provides recommended TypeScript linting rules.
- "plugin:@next/next/recommended": Provides Next.js-specific linting rules.
- "next": Provides linting rules for Next.js projects
- "next/core-web-vitals": Provides linting rules for core web vitals.

### Rules

- "quotes": This rule enforces the use of double quotes for strings instead of single quotes. The option "avoidEscape": true prevents the use of escaped double quotes inside strings.
- "@typescript-eslint/quotes": Similar to the above rule, this one enforces the use of double quotes for strings in TypeScript files instead of single quotes.
- "react/react-in-jsx-scope": This rule enforces that React must be imported in files that contain JSX. However, since React 17, this is not necessary, so this rule is turned off.
- "react/prop-types": This rule checks if the component's props are defined using prop types. However, this project uses TypeScript for type checking, so this rule is turned off.
- "react/jsx-props-no-spreading": This rule prevents the use of the spread operator (...) to spread props in JSX elements. This is turned off in the configuration.
- "prettier/prettier": ["error"] is a rule that enforces code formatting as per the rules defined in your `.prettierrc` configuration file.
- "no-unused-vars": ["error",] is a rule that prevents variables from being declared and not used in the code. It will give an error if any variable is unused except for variables that starts with "*".
- "no-empty": ["error", { "allowEmptyCatch": true }] is a rule that prevents empty code blocks. It will raise an error when an empty block is found, but allows empty catch statements.
- "react-hooks/rules-of-hooks": "error" is a rule that enforces React hooks to be called in a specific order and only at the top level of a component.
- "react-hooks/exhaustive-deps": "warn" is a rule that warns when a hook dependency is missing, meaning it will raise a warning when a hook's dependencies array might not include all of the values that the hook is using.
- "no-console": "warn" is a rule that raises a warning when a console statement is used in the code.
- "no-undef": "off" is a rule that would raise an error when an variable is used before it is defined, but this particular configuration turns this rule off, meaning it will not raise an error for that issue.
- "import/no-unresolved": "off" and "import/extensions": "off" are rules that would raise an error if an imported module is not found or if the import statement does not include the correct file extension. These rules are turned off in this configuration.
- "jsx-a11y/anchor-is-valid": "off" is a rule that would raise an error when `next/link` component is used in a way that does not include an href attribute in the anchor tag. This rule is turned off in this configuration.
